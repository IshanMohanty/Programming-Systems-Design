CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]


1. Flood-Fill Algorithm for recursive uncovering of squares 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill

----------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS or LIMITATIONS:

In comparison to the web based game:

1. Performance statistics like timing, number of clicks used to complete game and leader board data is not implemented for
   the user to see.

2. When we click on an uncovered square with an associated mine that is either satisfied properly or not, more squares are uncovered. 
   if mine guess is placed correctly by the user next to the uncovered square, the click on the uncovered square opens up many other 
   squares and forms a boundary till it encounters a mine. If the mine guess is incorrect, it forcibly opens up the exploded mine 
   in the incorrect mine guess position when you click on the already uncovered mine.
   This feature above is implemented only in the web-based game and is not handled in our game.
   So when user clicks on an already covered square, nothing happens.
